Excel project

Here's a summary of my first project where I used such features like absolute and relative relationship. I also used the functions such as Sum, Avg, Min, Max and also personal used formulas. 

Absolute and Relative Relationships:

Use absolute references ($) when you want a cell reference to remain constant while copying the formula to other cells. For example, if your data is in column A and you want to sum up values in column B for each row, use $A1 as the reference for the first row and drag it down to maintain the column reference.

Use relative references when you want the reference to adjust as you copy the formula to other cells. For instance, if you want to calculate the average of a range of cells, like =AVERAGE(B2:B10), you can copy this formula to other cells, and the reference will change accordingly.
